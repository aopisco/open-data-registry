Name: Tabula Sapiens
Description: |
  Tabula Sapiens will be a benchmark, first-draft human cell atlas of two million cells from 25 organs of eight normal human subjects. 
  Taking the organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment, and epigenetic effects, and allows detailed analysis and comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. 
  Our work creates a detailed portrait of cell types as well as their distribution and variation in gene expression across tissues and within the endothelial, epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. 
  A critical factor in the Tabula projects is our large collaborative network of PIâ€™s with deep expertise at preparation of diverse organs, enabling all organs from a subject to be successfully processed within a single day. 
  Tabula Sapiens leverages our network of human tissue experts and a close collaboration with a Donor Network West, a not-for-profit organ procurement organization. 
  We use their experience to balance and assign cell types from each tissue compartment and optimally mix high-quality plate-seq data and high-volume droplet-based data to provide a broad and deep benchmark atlas. 
  Our goal is to make sequence data rapidly and broadly available to the scientific community as a community resource. Before you use our data please Data Release Policy available at http://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/whereisthedata
